// Q2. Why must a java file name match the class name?
//
// Answer: To avoid errors at compile time within the java language the class
// name within a .java file must have or contain the same name as the .java
// file. As java is a language that comprises of classes and objects which
// therefore indicates that the .java file is just a class of the directory that
// it is in.
