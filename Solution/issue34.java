//The difference between widening type casting and narrowing type casting
//Widening type casting is actually known as implicit type casting in which a smaller type is converted into a larger type.
// This  is done by the compiler automatically.
//While the narrowing type casting is really known as an explicit type casting or explicit type conversion which is done by the programmer manually.
//It is when a programmer changes the variable type while writing the code.
