In Java, case sensitivity means that the language treats uppercase and lowercase letters as different.
So, for example, Variable, variable, and VARIABLE are considered three different identifiers (variable names).
This affects:
Variable names
Method names
Class names

Example:
int age = 25;
int Age = 30;
These are two different variables:
age stores 25
Age stores 30
Even though they look similar, Java treats them as separate because of the difference in capitalization.
