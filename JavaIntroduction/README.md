# What is Java?

**Java** is a popular, high-level, object-oriented programming language created in **1995** by **James Gosling** at **Sun Microsystems** (which was later acquired by Oracle).

Java is now owned by **Oracle**, and it's estimated that **more than 3 billion devices** run Java.

## Java is commonly used for:

- Mobile applications (especially Android apps)
- Desktop applications
- Web applications
- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connections
- And much, much more!


# Why Use Java?

- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast, and powerful
- It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object-oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

# Getting Started with Java

Java is a powerful, platform-independent programming language. Here's how to get started writing and running Java code on your machine.

## âœ… Step 1: Install Java Development Kit (JDK)

To compile and run Java programs, you need to install the **JDK** (Java Development Kit).

- Visit: [https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- Download and install the JDK for your operating system.
- After installation, verify it by running in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

# Java Code Compilation Process

The Java compilation process converts human-readable Java source code into machine-executable bytecode. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how Java code is compiled and executed.


### Writing the Source Code
- Java code is written in plain text files with a `.java` extension (e.g., `MyProgram.java`).
- The code contains classes, methods, and other Java constructs following the language's syntax.

### Compilation by the Java Compiler (javac)
- The Java compiler, `javac`, processes the `.java` file.
- It checks for syntax errors and translates the source code into bytecode, producing a `.class` file (e.g., `MyProgram.class`).
- Bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate representation of the program.

### Bytecode Generation
- The `.class` file contains bytecode, which is a set of instructions for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- Bytecode is portable, meaning it can run on any device with a compatible JVM, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

### Class Loading by the JVM
- When the program is executed (using the `java` command), the JVM loads the `.class` file into memory.
- The Class Loader subsystem handles loading, linking, and initializing the classes.

### Bytecode Verification
- The JVM verifies the bytecode to ensure it is valid and safe (e.g., no invalid operations or security violations).
- This step prevents corrupted or malicious code from running.

### Execution by the JVM
- The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into native machine code using the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
- The JIT compiler optimizes the bytecode for the specific hardware, improving performance.
- The program is then executed, producing the desired output.

## Key Components
- **Java Compiler (javac)**: Converts source code to bytecode.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes bytecode, providing platform independence.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler**: Optimizes bytecode to native code at runtime.

## Example Workflow
1. Write a Java program:
   ```java
   public class MyProgram {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("Hello, World!");
       }
   }
```
```

```


# Java Syntax Guide
This guide introduces the basic syntax of Java, using a simple "Hello World" program as an example. It explains the structure of a Java program, key components, and common pitfalls for beginners.
Example: Hello World Program
Below is a basic Java program that prints "Hello World" to the screen:
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

### Expected Output:
```java
Hello World
```
### Key Components Explained
1. **Class Declaration**

Every Java program requires a class: All executable code must reside inside a class.
Class name rules:
The class name (e.g., Main) should start with an uppercase letter (convention).
The file name must match the class name exactly and end with .java (e.g., Main.java).


Case sensitivity: Java is case-sensitive, so Main and main are treated as different names.

Example:
```java
public class Main { // Class name matches file name: Main.java
    // Code goes here
}
```

Note: Save the file with the exact class name (e.g., Main.java) to avoid compilation errors.
2. The main Method

The main method is the entry point of every Java program.
It must have the following signature:public static void main(String[] args)


Explanation of keywords:
public: The method is accessible from outside the class.
static: The method belongs to the class, not an instance of it.
void: The method does not return a value.
String[] args: An array of String arguments passed to the program (useful for command-line inputs).


Any code inside the main method's curly braces {} is executed when the program runs.

Example:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Code here runs when the program starts
}
```

3. **Printing Output with System.out.println()**

The **System.out.println()** method prints text to the console, followed by a new line.
Breakdown:
System: A built-in Java class that provides access to system resources.
out: A static member of System, representing the output stream (usually the console).
println(): A method that prints a line of text and adds a newline character.


```java
Syntax:System.out.println("Text to print");
```

Each statement in Java must end with a semicolon (;).

Example:
```java
System.out.println("Hello World"); // Prints "Hello World" and moves to the next line
```
Note: Use System.out.print() if you want to print without a newline.
4. Code Blocks and Syntax Rules

Curly braces ``{}``: Define the start and end of a block of code (e.g., class or method body).
Semicolons ``(;)``: End each statement to separate it from the next.
Indentation: While not required, indenting code (e.g., 4 spaces or 1 tab) improves readability.

Running the Program

Save the file: Ensure the file name matches the class name (e.g., Main.java).
Compile the code: Use the command javac Main.java to generate a Main.class file.
Run the program: Use the command java Main to execute the program.
Prerequisite: Ensure Java is installed (see Java Installation Guide).

**Common Errors to Avoid**

Mismatched file and class names: The file name must match the public class name (e.g., Main.java for public class Main).
Missing semicolon: Forgetting ; after a statement causes a compilation error.
Case sensitivity issues: Ensure correct capitalization (e.g., Main vs. main).
Incorrect main method signature: The main method must be exactly **public static void main(String[] args)**.

**Notes**

Java is a case-sensitive language, so always check capitalization.
The main method is mandatory for standalone programs.
Use meaningful class names that reflect the program's purpose.
Practice proper indentation to make your code easier to read.
