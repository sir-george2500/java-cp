- Web servers and application servers
- Games
- Database connections
- And much, much more!


# Why Use Java?

- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
- It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- It is open-source and free
- It is secure, fast, and powerful
- It has huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
- Java is an object-oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

# Get Started
